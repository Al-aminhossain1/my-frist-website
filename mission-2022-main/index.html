                <h1>What is coding?</h1>
                <p> Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a
                    computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning
                    to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use
                    this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.

                <p>The purpose of enrolling in this course is to develop yourself or to develop your career by learning
                    something well. Although at the moment I am not focusing on my career, I am focusing only on
                    learning. Because I believe that if I can learn something well or become proficient then I don't
                    have to worry about my career. So i have to take my development to the unlimited stage. </p>

            <p>
                You might not realize it, but by donating blood, you’re essentially giving the gift of life to someone
                in need in your community. Blood donations are constantly needed to ensure that there’s an ample fresh
                supply on hand to provide for those who need blood transfusions because of illness or injury.

                Imagine if you or one of family members needed blood in an emergency and it just wasn’t available?
                Taking an hour out of your busy schedule to donate at our upcoming blood drive can protect our
                community’s blood supply and help save the life of someone in our community
